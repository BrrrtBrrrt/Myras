- Mini-Batch gradient descent
- Layer types: Input, Dense
- Activation functions: Rectified linear unit (ReLU), Linear
- Loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimizer types: Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM)
- Tensor operations (differentiable): Dot product, Transpose, Square root, Division, Multiplication, Subtraction, Addition
- Supports tensor/matrix shape broadcasting

## Status
